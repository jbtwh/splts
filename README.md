Implement a tool to find for a given Dribbble.com user Top10 "likers" among thecombined likers of all his/her followers. Written answers to the questions from the gist fileare optional but you should be ready to discuss all of them during your on­site interview.2. Implement a function to check whether a given string matches a predefined URL patternand to extract predefined parts from it (e. g., query parameters, path segments).Based on our experience, those tasks shouldn't take more than 8 hours. Feel free to use anyprogramming language to implement them, but in case you don't have any other Clojurecode to show us it might be a good idea to use Clojure.Use GitHub/Bitbucket (or other similar service) to host your solution. And feel free tocontact us in case you have any questions.
