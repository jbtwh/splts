Task

You have to create a tool to calculate Dribbble stats:

For a given Dribbble user find all followers
For each follower find all shots
For each shot find all "likers"
Calculate Top10 "likers"
Questions to think about

How to deal with Dribbble API Limits?
What if we have a server that respond to incoming requests instead of CLI tool?
What if I want to stop process and restart from a some kind of "savepoint"?
Futures VS. Async VS. Streaming VS. Deferreds VS. "you-name-it"?
How to use systems like Storm OR Summingbird OR Spark OR Onyx to solve tasks like this?
